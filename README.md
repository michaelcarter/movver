# Movver.js
Movver provides the **concept of a hover** on mobile devices. It does this by keeping a log of where you're tapping to scroll and then figures out what you're most likely looking at on the remaining viewable portion of the screen. It has no dependencies, and works in all major browsers. Simply attach callbacks to page elements and they'll be executed as they're being looked at.

## Usage scenarios
- Pre-caching of content behind tappable page elements
- Lazy loading images
- Revealing content as it's viewed
